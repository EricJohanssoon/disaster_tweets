# ðŸ’¬ disaster_tweets

Made a submission for a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started" target="_blank">Kaggle challenge</a> where the task was to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which oneâ€™s arenâ€™t. A dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified were given.
